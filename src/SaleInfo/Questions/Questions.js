          <li>
            <h4>Can I send money from an exchange wallet like Coinbase?</h4>
            <p>
              No, do not send money from an exchange wallet. If for any reason
              we need to return funds back to your wallet, funds that were
              originally sent from an exchange wallet will be lost and you will
              not be able to receive the tokens you purchase.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>When will i receive my tokens?</h4>
            <p>
              After you participate on the token sale. 
              The speed at which you recieve your funds is dependent on 
              the gas fees you choose to pay. Tokens will be transferable immediately.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>How can I trust I am sending to the official OWL address?</h4>
            <p>
              Always triple check that you are on the official dock.io URL (The
              official token sale page is crowdsale.stealthswap.org).
